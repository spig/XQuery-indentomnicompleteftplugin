This plugin configures Vim to be a little more efficient at editing XQuery...!

It also sets up Exuberant Ctags for XQuery, since it's not one of the supported languages.

ftplugin/xquery.vim: 
    -Makes keys like gd and<C-]> and i_CTRL-p work better when editing XQuery files by temporarily adding the hyphen - to the 'iskeyword' option
    -Sets options useful when editing XQuery (like 'set comments')
    -Sets a few variables to make matchit.vim and taglist.vim work better with XQuery
    -Comment regions out via surround.vim by visually selecting an area, then pressing Sc


xquerycomplete.vim:
    -Completes W3C XQuery 'fn' functions, types and keywords. 
    -Also completes any MarkLogic functions I could find at...  http://developer.marklogic.com/pubs/4.1/apidocs/All.html

        Examples:

            fn<CTRL-x><CTRL-o>
               ->  list of functions in the 'fn' namespace

            fn:doc<CTRL-x><CTRL-o>
               ->  fn:doc(
                   fn:doc-available(
                   fn:document-uri(

            xs<CTRL-x><CTRL-o>
               ->  list of all xquery types

            decl<CTRL-x><CTRL-o>
               ->  declare
                   declare function
                   declare namespace
                   declare option
                   declare default


indent/xquery.vim:
    - It can recognize complex FLOWR expressions. For example in the example below,
      if in insert mode, hitting enter after the first line will immediately align the cursor with the 'for'.

      Also,  typing out the 'let' in the fourth line will immediately re-indent the line to align with the 'let' on the first line.


             let $foo := for $editor in $editors
                         where not(contains($editor, "emacs"))
                         return $editor
             let $bar := "bar"
             return
                   $bar
